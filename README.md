Strangers, by rock band Bring Me The Horizon, is a song written during the pandemic about the collective loneliness and struggle of day-to-day life that everyone goes through, which in and of itself unites us as strangers going through life together. This website aims to use the powerful lyrics of this song and translate them to an experience that reflects on the meaning of the words. Each page has a word to click to navigate to the next, as you go from the end of the first verse through the first chorus, and back again. Use the restart button at any point to go back to the first page. 


On each page there are are hover effects, animations, or both. There are several cases of entire words having each letter as an individual ID in order to spread the letters across the screen in a hover effect or animation. Most everything on each page is set to absolute positions relative to the viewport size, in order to place things exactly where intended.
